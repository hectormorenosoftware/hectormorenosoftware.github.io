This is an example on how to create a basic website using React, Redux, and React Router with Webpack.

To install dependencies
npm install

To run type in the root
npm start

To build run
npm run build

Remember the dist folder can be hosted at AWS, Heroku, or Netlify. When you make a dist folder you can click on the index.html file and you will see how your website looks like without hosting the website on the server.
